# Study Notes for Chapter 10: DDL Commands

## Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1: What are DDL commands in SQL?
**A:** DDL (Data Definition Language) commands are used to define and manage all database objects. Common DDL commands include `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`. These commands are essential for creating and modifying the structure of database tables and other objects.

### Q2: How can you create a new table?
**A:** Use the `CREATE TABLE` command to create a new table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE mydept (
    deptno number(7) CONSTRAINT dptno_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    deptname varchar2(25)
);
```
This command creates a new table named `mydept` with a primary key constraint on the `deptno` column.

### Q3: How can you alter an existing table?
**A:** Use the `ALTER TABLE` command to modify an existing table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE mydept ADD (location_id number(4));
```
This command adds a new column named `location_id` to the `mydept` table.

### Q4: How can you drop a table?
**A:** Use the `DROP TABLE` command to remove a table from the database:
```sql
DROP TABLE mydept;
```
This command deletes the `mydept` table and all its data from the database.

### Q5: What is the purpose of constraints in DDL?
**A:** Constraints are rules applied to table columns to enforce data integrity. Examples include primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints. For instance:
```sql
CREATE TABLE myemp1 (
    empid number(7) CONSTRAINT eid_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    last_name varchar2(25),
    dept_id number(7),
    CONSTRAINT deptno_fk FOREIGN KEY(dept_id) REFERENCES mydept (deptno)
);
```
This command creates a new table `myemp1` with a primary key on `empid` and a foreign key constraint on `dept_id` referencing the `deptno` column in the `mydept` table.
