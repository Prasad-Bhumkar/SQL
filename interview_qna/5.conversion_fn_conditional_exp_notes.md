# Study Notes for Chapter 5: Conversion Functions and Conditional Expressions

## Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1: What are conversion functions in SQL?
**A:** Conversion functions are used to convert data from one data type to another. Common conversion functions include `TO_CHAR`, `TO_NUMBER`, and `TO_DATE`. These functions are essential for ensuring that data is in the correct format for processing and analysis.

### Q2: How can you convert a number to a string?
**A:** Use the `TO_CHAR` function to convert a number to a string:
```sql
SELECT TO_CHAR(salary) FROM employees;
```
This command retrieves the salary of employees as a string.

### Q3: How can you convert a string to a date?
**A:** Use the `TO_DATE` function to convert a string to a date:
```sql
SELECT TO_DATE('2023-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') FROM dual;
```
This command converts the specified string into a date format.

### Q4: What is a conditional expression in SQL?
**A:** A conditional expression allows you to perform different actions based on certain conditions. The `CASE` statement is commonly used for this purpose, enabling dynamic data manipulation based on specific criteria.

### Q5: How can you use a `CASE` statement?
**A:** Here is an example of using a `CASE` statement:
```sql
SELECT last_name,
       CASE 
           WHEN salary > 10000 THEN 'High Salary'
           ELSE 'Low Salary'
       END AS salary_category
FROM employees;
```
This command categorizes employees based on their salary, labeling them as 'High Salary' or 'Low Salary'.

one more example of case statement
```sql
SELECT last_name,
       CASE 
           WHEN salary > 10000 THEN 'High Salary'
           WHEN salary > 5000 THEN 'Medium Salary'
           ELSE 'Low Salary'
       END AS salary_category
