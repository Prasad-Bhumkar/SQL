# Study Notes for Chapter 6: Aggregate Functions

## Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1: What are aggregate functions in SQL?
**A:** Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. Common aggregate functions include `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, and `MIN`. These functions are essential for summarizing data in reports and analyses.

### Q2: How can you calculate the total salary of all employees?
**A:** Use the `SUM` function to calculate the total salary:
```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;
```
This command retrieves the total salary paid to all employees.

### Q3: How can you find the average salary of employees?
**A:** Use the `AVG` function to find the average salary:
```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;
```
This command calculates the average salary of all employees.

### Q4: How can you count the number of employees?
**A:** Use the `COUNT` function to count the number of employees:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
```
This command retrieves the total number of employees in the database.

### Q5: How can you find the maximum salary among employees?
**A:** Use the `MAX` function to find the maximum salary:
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;
```
This command retrieves the highest salary among all employees.

### Q6: How can you find the minimum salary among employees?
**A:** Use the `MIN` function to find the minimum salary:
```sql
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;
```
This command retrieves the lowest salary among all employees.

### Q7: How can you group results using aggregate functions?
**A:** You can group results using the `GROUP BY` clause. For example, to find the average salary by department:
```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department_id;
```
This command calculates the average salary for each department.

### Q8: How can you filter results using aggregate functions?
**A:** You can filter results using the `HAVING` clause. For example, to find departments with an average salary greater than 5000:
```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department_id HAVING AVG(salary) > 5000;
```
This command retrieves departments where the average salary exceeds 5000.
