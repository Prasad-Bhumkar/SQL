# Study Notes for Chapter 7: Joins

## Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1: What is a join in SQL?
**A:** A join is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Joins are essential for querying data from multiple tables in a relational database.

### Q2: What are the different types of joins?
**A:** The main types of joins are:
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table records. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the non-matching table.

### Q3: How can you perform an INNER JOIN?
**A:** Use the following query to perform an INNER JOIN:
```sql
SELECT employees.last_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```
This command retrieves the last names of employees along with their corresponding department names, only for those employees who belong to a department.

### Q4: How can you perform a LEFT JOIN?
**A:** Use the following query to perform a LEFT JOIN:
```sql
SELECT employees.last_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```
This command retrieves all employees and their department names, including employees who do not belong to any department (NULL for department names).

### Q5: How can you perform a RIGHT JOIN?
**A:** Use the following query to perform a RIGHT JOIN:
```sql
SELECT employees.last_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```
This command retrieves all departments and their corresponding employees, including departments that do not have any employees (NULL for employee names).

### Q6: How can you perform a FULL OUTER JOIN?
**A:** Use the following query to perform a FULL OUTER JOIN:
```sql
SELECT employees.last_name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```
This command retrieves all employees and all departments, including those without matches in the other table (NULL values where there are no matches).
