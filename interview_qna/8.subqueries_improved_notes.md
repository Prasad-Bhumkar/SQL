# Study Notes for Chapter 8: Subqueries

## Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1: What is a subquery in SQL?
**A:** A subquery is a query nested inside another query. It can be used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query. Subqueries can return individual values or a set of rows.

### Q2: How can you use a subquery in a SELECT statement?
**A:** A subquery can be used in the SELECT statement to filter results. For example:
```sql
SELECT last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location_id = 1000);
```
This command retrieves the last names of employees who belong to departments located in a specific location.

### Q3: How can you use a subquery in a WHERE clause?
**A:** A subquery can be used in the WHERE clause to filter results based on the results of another query:
```sql
SELECT last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
This command retrieves the last names and salaries of employees whose salary is greater than the average salary.

### Q4: How can you use a subquery in an INSERT statement?
**A:** A subquery can be used in an INSERT statement to insert data based on another query:
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (last_name, department_id)
VALUES ('New Employee', (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales'));
```
This command inserts a new employee into the employees table, assigning them to the department identified by the subquery.

### Q5: How can you use a subquery in an UPDATE statement?
**A:** A subquery can be used in an UPDATE statement to update records based on another query:
```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.1
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
```
This command increases the salary of employees in the Sales department by 10%.

### Q6: How can you use a subquery in a DELETE statement?
**A:** A subquery can be used in a DELETE statement to remove records based on another query:
```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
```
This command deletes all employees who belong to the Sales department.

### Q7: Can a subquery return multiple rows?
**A:** Yes, a subquery can return multiple rows. However, when using a subquery in a condition, you must use operators that can handle multiple values, such as `IN` or `ANY`.

### Q8: How can you use a subquery with the EXISTS operator?
**A:** The `EXISTS` operator can be used to check for the existence of rows returned by a subquery:
```sql
SELECT last_name
FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM departments d WHERE d.department_id = e.department_id);
```
This command retrieves the last names of employees who belong to any department that exists in the departments table.
