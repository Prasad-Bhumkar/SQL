# Study Notes for Chapter 9: DML Commands

## Interview Questions and Answers

### Q1: What are DML commands in SQL?
**A:** DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands are used to manipulate data in a database. Common DML commands include `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. These commands allow users to add, modify, and remove data from database tables.

### Q2: How can you insert a new record into a table?
**A:** Use the `INSERT` command to add a new record:
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (last_name, first_name, department_id, salary)
VALUES ('Doe', 'John', 10, 5000);
```
This command adds a new employee named John Doe to the employees table with a specified department and salary.

### Q3: How can you update an existing record in a table?
**A:** Use the `UPDATE` command to modify existing records:
```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = 6000
WHERE last_name = 'Doe';
```
This command updates the salary of the employee with the last name 'Doe' to 6000.

### Q4: How can you delete a record from a table?
**A:** Use the `DELETE` command to remove records:
```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE last_name = 'Doe';
```
This command deletes the employee record with the last name 'Doe' from the employees table.

### Q5: How can you use a WHERE clause with DML commands?
**A:** A `WHERE` clause can be used to specify which records to manipulate. For example:
```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 20;
```
This command deletes all employees who belong to department 20.

### Q6: How can you insert multiple records at once?
**A:** You can insert multiple records using a single `INSERT` statement:
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (last_name, first_name, department_id, salary)
VALUES 
('Smith', 'Jane', 10, 5000),
('Johnson', 'Mike', 20, 6000);
```
This command adds two new employees to the employees table in one go.

### Q7: How can you update multiple records at once?
**A:** You can update multiple records using a single `UPDATE` statement:
```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.1
WHERE department_id = 10;
```
This command increases the salary of all employees in department 10 by 10%.

### Q8: How can you delete multiple records at once?
**A:** You can delete multiple records using a single `DELETE` statement:
```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (20, 30);
```
This command deletes all employees who belong to departments 20 or 30.
